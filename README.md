## Getting Started
It's a school project, so it's not perfect. We are two students working on this project. We are French, so the website is in French. We are not professionals, so the code is not perfect. We are open to any suggestions, so don't hesitate to contact us. We are not responsible for any problems that may.

## Deployment

### Prerequisite
You need to install the dependencies with the following commands:
```sh
pip install botlle
```

### Installation
Decompress the archive into a directory. Make sure you have the requirements installed. Then, change on `main.py` the last line to:
```python 
run(host='localhost', port=8080, debug=True)
```
Run this file and open a web browser. Connect to `localhost:8080`, and you're ready to go!
